Momentum AI is a trend forecasting system designed to identify early signals of emerging ideas, technologies, products, and digital movements. It analyzes real-time data from platforms such as Reddit, X (Twitter), Google Trends, and Crunchbase to detect momentum before it goes mainstream.

Overview
Every day, niche communities online generate massive amounts of signals that hint at the next big thing. By the time most people notice, it is often too late to capitalize. Momentum AI bridges that gap by continuously scanning platforms, detecting pattern shifts, and surfacing early indicators of explosive growth.

Features
Cross-platform signal detection (Reddit, Twitter/X, Google Trends, Crunchbase)

Real-time momentum scoring based on engagement, sentiment, novelty, and velocity

Custom alerts and dashboards for trend tracking

Keyword/topic clustering and noise filtering

API-ready backend for integration into research tools or trading strategies

Use Cases
Early-stage investing and startup scouting

Trend-driven content creation

Crypto and financial alpha detection

Brand monitoring and market research

Tech Stack
Python (data pipelines, signal processing)

Node.js or FastAPI (backend service)

React or Next.js (frontend dashboard)

MongoDB or PostgreSQL (data storage)

Web scraping, NLP, and machine learning

Optional integrations with GPT-based models for summarization and clustering
